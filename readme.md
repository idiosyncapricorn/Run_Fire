# Wildfire Information App

## Overview

This app is designed for Californians during wildfire season, providing them with crucial information and resources to stay safe and informed. The app will display real-time data related to wildfires, air quality, and safety tips.

### Features

- **Wildfire Maps**: Interactive maps displaying ongoing wildfire events across California.
- **Air Quality Index (AQI)**: Live updates on air quality to help users make informed decisions.
- **Resources**: Links to important resources and organizations dedicated to wildfire response and recovery.

### Upcoming iOS App

An iOS app version of this project is currently in development, allowing users to access all features on their mobile devices. Stay tuned for updates!

## Development Status

**This application is still in development and is not ready for use.** We are actively working on improving features and ensuring everything runs smoothly before the official launch.

## Motivation

This project was created for the **2024 Harvard Hackathon**, where our goal is to leverage technology to provide support to communities affected by wildfires.

## Installation

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<USERNAME>/<REPO_NAME>.git

	2.	Navigate to the project directory:

cd <REPO_NAME>


	3.	Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


	4.	Run the Flask application:

python app.py


	5.	Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to view the app.

Optimized Performance Note

For optimized map performance, consider setting the map’s center longitude and latitude to San Francisco:

	•	Latitude: 37.7749
	•	Longitude: -122.4194

Although longitude and latitude have been removed for flexibility, using the San Francisco coordinates as a default center can improve user experience in this region.
